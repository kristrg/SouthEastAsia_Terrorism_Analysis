# SouthEast Asia - Terrorism Analysis
The idea of this project came from the curiosity of terrorism activities in South East Asia - a region that I'm living in but I have no clue what's going on in this beloved region - and the hope for peace overall.

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Global Terrorism Database (http://start.umd.edu/gtd) - an open-source database, which provides information on US and international terrorist attacks around the world since 1970, and now includes more than 200,000 events. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible.

The raw dataset comprises of more than 200,000 rows with 135 columns. Data pre-processing steps were applied including: Cleaning - Changing Datatype - Working with Missing Data - Check duplications/Mislabeled and corrupted data, etc.

## Project Description
This project was done with contributions from 3 members in 2 weeks from collecting data, pre-processing, EDA and presentation on GDS dashboard. Each member in the group was responsible for a particular aspect of researching such as the world overview situation, regions situation & terrorist groups info.

My task in this project includes steps of data-analysis pipeline and focus on analysing from the economical perspective, which was eventually chosen to be the main topic for presentation.

## Outline
1. Determining questions for analysis purpose
2. Data collecting
3. Preprocessing data
4. EDA
5. GDS Report

### 1-Questions
- What's the terrorism situation like in SEA region? (# of incidents, # of casualities, time range)
- Which countries are most affected by terrorism in the region?
- Which terrorist group makes the most money from terrorism activities & from which sources?

### 2-Data Preprocessing

- There are 135 columns in the dataset, however, I choose to use only around 20 to answer the questions

- For the number of terrorism incidents, the trend was upward & peaked in 2013 then slowly decreased but still greater than the figure of pre-2010 period.
- The Phillipines & Thailand are 2 countries in SEA that most heavily affected by terrorism

## Conclusion
By analysing the ransom amount received from terrorism activities, we found out that Abu Sayyaf was the group that made the most money in SEA region. Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest and most violent jihadist groups in the southern Philippines. Its name means "bearer of the sword" and it is notorious for kidnapping for ransom, and for attacks on civilians and the army.
